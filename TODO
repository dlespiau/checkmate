== Checkmate

- README.adoc
- Count make errors as build errors:
  make: *** [modules] Error 2
- Make the 'build' artefact a bit more meta: a class able to build everything
  (kernel, autotools projects, ...) instead of having two build classes at the
  same level (and select between them in the config file)
- We should invalidate the DB if .mateconfig changes (keep a checksum of the
  file in .mate)
- show command showing artefacts
- kdoc warnings
- kdoc warnings for drm and i915 only
- gtkdoc warnings (i-g-t)
- distcheck (i-g-t)

== Maybe one day

- Find a way to make all artefacts part of the git tree so a fetch/push also
  transfers them

== Tests

- give a non-existent directory to -C
- test that generates errors (linux-build)
- test that generates warnings (linux-build)
- A more friendly error message for config errors (say if the artefact name is
  unknown or invalid syntax)
- Using a tag as refspec doesn't give a hash (and wong log messaged as well a
  corrupted DB)
